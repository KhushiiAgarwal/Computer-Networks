Important commands for Networking
1. A ping (Packet Internet or Inter-Network Groper) is a basic Internet program that allows a user to test and verify if a particular destination IP address exists and can accept requests in computer network administration.
  ```
  Ping
  ```
2. Path ping is used to troubleshoot network issues, particularly the ones related to latency and network performance. It combines tracert & ping
  ```
Pathping
  ```
3. The TRACERT diagnostic utility determines the route to a destination by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo packets to the destination
  ```
tracert
  ```
4. ipconfig (standing for "Internet Protocol configuration") is a console application program of some computer operating systems that displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings.
 ```
ipconfig
 ```
5. The arp command displays and modifies the Internet-to-adapter address translation tables used by the Address in Networks and communication management. The arp command displays the current ARP entry for the host specified by the HostName variable.
 ```
arp 
```
 ```
arp -a
```
6. Nslookup (stands for “Name Server Lookup”) is a useful command for getting information from the DNS server. It is a network administration tool for querying the Domain Name System (DNS) to obtain domain name or IP address mapping or any other specific DNS record. 
 ```
nslookup
  ```
7. The netstat command generates displays that show network status and protocol statistics. 
 ```
netstat
  ```
  8. The nbtstat command is a diagnostic tool for NetBIOS over TCP/IP.
  ```
  nbtstat
```
9. Hostname is a simple command used to view and set the hostname of a system.
 ```
hostname
```
10. The route command resolves all symbolic names into addresses, using either the /etc/hosts file or the network name server. Routes to a particular host are distinguished from those to a network by interpreting the Internet address associated with the destination
 ```
route
  ```
