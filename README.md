This repo includes
1. Line Encoding
  - For this ensure download and complete set up for graphics.h for VS Code/Turbo C for Line Encoding C program.
2. Djikstra and shortest path for Routing Table
  - Implementation of simple Djikstra which can be modified to use for Routing Table
3. CRC and Hamming code
4. Go back N & selective repeat Sliding window protocol
5. Client Server and Socket Programming for TCP-UDP Berkley Sockets in Sender-Reciever 
6. UDP and TCP socket programming using Client-Server

For client-server/socket programming (3-6 program use these in command prompt to run JAVA file):
- Open command prompt using **cmd**: (for file name=tcp.java)
