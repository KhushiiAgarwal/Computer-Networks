This repo includes
1. Line Encoding
2. Djikstra and shortest path for Routing Table
  - Implementation of simple Djikstra which can be modified to use for Routing Table
3. CRC and Hamming code
4. Go back N & selective repeat Sliding window protocol
5. Client Server and Socket Programming for TCP-UDP Berkley Sockets in Sender-Reciever 
6. UDP and TCP socket programming using Client-Server
##### Line Encoding
- For this ensure download and complete set up for graphics.h for VS Code/Turbo C: [https://github.com/ullaskunder3/Solution-to-graphics.h]
For client-server/socket programming (3-6 program use these in command prompt to run JAVA file):
- Open command prompt using **cmd**: (for file name=tcp.java)

#### Hamming code
```
javac HammingSender.java
```
```
java HammingSender
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac HammingReceiver.java
```
```
java HammingReceiver
```

#### CRC
```
javac CRCSender.java
```
```
java CRCSender
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac CRCReceiver.java
```
```
java CRCReceiver
```

#### Go Back to N Sliding Window Protocol
```
javac GoBackNSender.java
```
```
java GoBackNSender
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac GoBackNReceiver.java
```
```
java GoBackNReceiver
```

#### Selective Repeat Sliding Window Protocol
```
javac SelectiveRepeatSender.java
```
```
java SelectiveRepeatSender
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac SelectiveRepeatReceiver.java
```
```
java SelectiveRepeatReceiver
```

#### TCP Sender-Receiver 
```
javac TCPSender.java
```
```
java TCPSender
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac TCPReceiver.java
```
```
java TCPReceiver
```

#### TCP Client-Server
```
javac TCPClient.java
```
```
java TCPClient
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac TCPServer.java
```
```
java TCPServer
```

#### UDP Sender-Receiver 
```
javac UDPSender.java
```
```
java UDPSender
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac UDPReceiver.java
```
```
java UDPReceiver
```

#### TCP Client-Server 
```
javac UDPClient.java
```
```
java UDPClient
```
Open (another) new cmd window and paste
```
javac UDPServer.java
```
```
java UDPServer
```

- open 2 command prompt to communicate simultaneously
- Begin with client/sender  with given above command
- Next write similar commands for server/receiver
